Title: Legend: Music For Everyone

Background:
  - Legend is a small idea I had in offering virtual music lessons to consumers who want a personalized music teaching session but within the comforts of their own home. 
  - It uses offers a service where it will match up customers with a musician who aligns with their music genre of choice. It prides itself on being technologically advanced, while also being incredibly easy to use for not only teachers but also students. 
  - Legend's main business will come from individuals who want to learn music and instructors who will pay a small monthly fee to have their services be listed on Legend's website.
